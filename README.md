# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built-in Neighborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.
My project is an image of a boba drink that is on a cyan background. The image depicts an outline of a drink that has an orange liquid in with boba pearls on the bottom of the drink or floating around in the drink. Said image is on a cyan background
   

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   I am proud of the boba painter subclass which paints the boba in my project and I am also proud of the Scrape method in my code which is in background painter whcih uses for loops.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   I would have liked to have a bigger canvas then I could actually make circles for the boba pearls instead of squares. If I had the chance I would have wanted to make different shades in the drink and boba pearls to add contrast.
